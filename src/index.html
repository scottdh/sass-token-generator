      <p>
        English mathematician Ada Lovelace, the daughter of poet Lord Byron, has
        been called "the first computer programmer" for writing an algorithm for
        a computing machine in the mid-1800s.
      </p>
      <h2>Who Was Ada Lovelace?</h2>

      <p>
        The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of
        Lovelace — better known as "Ada Lovelace" — showed her gift for
        mathematics at an early age. She translated an article on an invention
        by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments. Because she introduced
        many computer concepts, Lovelace is considered the first computer
        programmer. She died on November 27, 1852.
      </p>

      <h2>Early Years</h2>
      <p>
        Ada Lovelace, born as Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, 1815, was the
        only legitimate child of the famous poet Lord George Gordon Byron. Lord
        Byron's marriage to Lovelace's mother, Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke
        Byron, was not a happy one. Lady Byron separated from her husband only
        weeks after their daughter was born. A few months later, Lord Byron left
        England, and Lovelace never saw her father again. He died in Greece when
        Ada was 8 years old.
      </p>

      <h3>Upbringing</h3>

      <p>
        Lovelace had an unusual upbringing for an aristocratic girl in the
        mid-1800s. At her mother's insistence, tutors taught her mathematics and
        science. Such challenging subjects were not standard fare for women at
        the time, but her mother believed that engaging in rigorous studies
        would prevent Lovelace from developing her father's moody and
        unpredictable temperament. Lovelace was also forced to lie still for
        extended periods of time because her mother believed it would help her
        develop self-control.
      </p>

      <p>
        From early on, Lovelace showed a talent for numbers and language. She
        received instruction from William Frend, a social reformer; William
        King, the family's doctor; and Mary Somerville, a Scottish astronomer
        and mathematician. Somerville was one of the first women to be admitted
        into the Royal Astronomical Society.
      </p>

      <h2>Babbage and the Analytical Engine</h2>

      <p>
        Around the age of 17, Ada met Charles Babbage, a mathematician and
        inventor. The pair became friends, and the much older Babbage served as
        a mentor to Lovelace. Through Babbage, Lovelace began studying advanced
        mathematics with University of London professor Augustus de Morgan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lovelace was fascinated by Babbage's ideas. Known as the father of the
        computer, he invented the difference engine, which was meant to perform
        mathematical calculations. Lovelace got a chance to look at the machine
        before it was finished, and was captivated by it. Babbage also created
        plans for another device known as the analytical engine, designed to
        handle more complex calculations.
